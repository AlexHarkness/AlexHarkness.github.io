                <h1>DIY Gas Masks</h1>
                <a>
               	With everything going on right now it makes sense to go out and protest, however, cops have been using tear gas on completely peaceful protestors. Given that tear gas is nearly shit it makes sense to make gasmask or two if you can. These plans all use activated charcoal which can be harmful to your lungs in its own right so be careful and don't use them if not necessary(please do some research on inhaling the dust). Some of these videos are pretty shitty I'll be the first to say that but they were the best resources that I could find.

                <h1>HARDWARE</h1>
                <a>On the hardware side of things, the watch houses a Nordic nRF52832 SoC. It is an ultra low-energy System-on-a-Chip that has built-in Bluetooth Low Energy features as well as a handful of other radios. Its excellent power management allows it to be powered for days on a 12mm CR1225 coin cell. Three clicky buttons serve as the input, capable of handling long presses as well as double/triple clicks. Dual 7-segment LEDs show the time, and five auxiliary LEDs serve either as indicator lights or bling. Yes, I know I could've slapped on an OLED screen for better graphics and battery life, but I think the cyberpunk vibe from the LEDs are completely worth it. There is a mini piezo buzzer capable of simple beeps and boops, but I haven't really implemented it in the firmware because its volume is too quiet. The CR1225 battery is too weak for the speaker.</a>
                <br><br>
                <a>The nRF52832 chip sports a real time clock with an accuracy of +/-5 seconds a month. However, since the clock doesn't have a backup battery, the time is lost when the coin cell runs out of juice. But with a Bluetooth connection to a computer or an Android smartphone, the time can easily be restored.</a>
                <br><br>
                <a>While the LEDs maintain a gorgeous aesthetic, it cripples the battery life. If I had used an OLED, for example, I believe the battery could have increased to about a week or more. Also, the segmented display becomes pretty dim after a few hours of use and stay that way until the battery dies. This is probably because the battery's nominal voltage of 3 volts is the minimum voltage for the display. The battery voltage is measured between 2.8 and 2.5 volts for the majority of the battery life. I think if I had used a 3.7v Lipo cell and a 3.3v regulator, the LEDs would stay at maximum brightness for the majority of the battery life.</a>
                <br><br>
                <h1>SOFTWARE</h1>
                <a>he nRF52832 is programmed with Espruino, a Javascript interpreter for ARM microcontrollers, written by Gordon Williams. I chose it because I was not yet familiar with ARM-GCC. While much slower than C and consumes more power, it still allows easy firmware updates and most importantly, instant feedback from the REPL through a bluetooth connection. This is pretty handy when adding new features to the firmware, since I don't need to upload the entire firmware every time I need to test something out.</a>
                <br><br>
                <a>The watch firmware is still pretty early in development. It only displays the time and nothing else. The code also needs some optimization since when telling the time, the segmented display becomes significantly dimmer than usual. I don't know yet whether this is a software issue or a battery issue, but I'll need to look more into it. Once I learn ARM-GCC(I'm working on it) I will re-write the entire firmware in C for maximum efficiency and power management.</a>
                <br><br>
                <h1>CONCLUSION</h1>
                <a>Overall, I'm pretty satisfied with my watch, especially on how it looks. I think it looks gorgeous. However, the weak power source and short battery life is a huge miss, not to mention that having to rely on a Javascript interpreter, while easier for me, isn't on the hardware. When I make the Mark 5, I will try to adress all the issues above.</a>
